# Project Statement :

# Project description :
Content Management System helps companies manage digital content. 
Whole teams can use these systems to create, edit, organize, and publish content. 
It acts as a single place to store content and provides automated processes for collaborative digital content management 
and creation using built-in (or designed) workflows.By providing an easy and cost-effective solution for content management, 
a CMS allows companies to manage and distribute their content without investing in a full-time content development team with
top CMS like wordpress,squarespace,mangolia etc.
